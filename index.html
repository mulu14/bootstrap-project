                       In an extraordinarily candid interview, 32-year-old Prince Harry, pictured left in May 2016, opens up about his troubled 20s and says how, after leaving the Army, he 'didn't want to grow up' and struggled to find a meaningful role for himself. Speaking to journalist Angela Levin - who revealed last week that Harry believes 'no one in the Royal Family wants to be King or Queen' - the Prince gave an astonishing insight into how he once felt directionless, and sought an escape from the pomp and pageantry surrounding him. 'I spent many years kicking my heels and I didn't want to grow up,' he admitted. Several years of partying, drinking and heavy smoking followed - which he has previously described as 'total chaos' - and Harry admitted coming 'very close' to a breakdown several times. And when he finally decided to be more constructive, he even questioned whether remaining a junior Royal would allow him to use his talents effectively - and considered life as a commoner instead. 'I felt I wanted out but then decided to stay in and work out a role for myself,' he said, making it clear he was primarily motivated by his loyalty to the Queen, with whom he is pictured top right. Harry, who was just 12 when his mother Princess Diana died, admitted feeling most at home during his years in the Army. He was devastated in 2007 when, after ten weeks as a soldier, pictured inset, in Afghanistan's Helmand province, his position was leaked by a magazine and he had to be hastily withdrawn for security reasons. Harry is pictured bottom right with his brother Prince William at their mother Princess Diana's funeral held at Westminster Abbey in 1997.
